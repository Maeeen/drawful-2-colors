To change color, just select a color (under the canvas), then, a color dialog will open. Select a color, and press ok.

After changing the color, the top bar (where your name is written) has changed color too. If not, retry again.

To get back to one of the original colors, just press "Def. Color 1" for the first default color and "Def. Color 2" for the second default color.

To change thickness, press "Cstm Thickness" and input a number.

To remove the last line you've drawn, just simply press "Clear last line". (:warning: There's no re-do option!)
