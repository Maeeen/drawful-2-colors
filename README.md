# Drawful 2 Cheat

* The default two colors of Drawful 2 are annoying ?
* You're an artist but you're limited to theses ?

## Features aka nice things

* Custom colors
* Custom thickness
* Clear the last line you've drawn
* ~~Better re-drawing of the canvas~~
* Ez win (if ur good)
* Don't say a thing about optimization etc... It's just a little script done in 10 minutes.

# How to..

## ..inject ?

To inject the script, before joining the game (= in the jackbox.tv main menu):
* open Developer Tools with F12 or CTRL+SHIFT+I
* go to Console
* paste the content of cheat.user.js inside the console
* press enter
* join the game

## ..use it as a userscript ?

To don't open the console every time you want to play, you can use the [TamperMonkey extension](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) and install the cheat.user.js script as an userscript !
(open cheat.user.js and click `Raw`, or [open this](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Maeeen/drawful-2-colors/master/cheat.user.js)

## ..win ?

-> Win !
